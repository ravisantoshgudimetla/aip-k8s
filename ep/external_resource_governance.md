# Design: External Resource Governance

**Status**: Draft

## 1. Problem Statement

The existing `GovernedResource` design governs K8s resources that exist at evaluation time. Extending it to external systems (GitHub, Terraform, Jira) raises three concerns:

1. **The Ordering Problem**: Agents that open GitHub PRs or Terraform plans — the artifact (PR, plan) does not exist at approval time (T1).
2. **The Enforcement Gap**: External systems have no native AIP admission hooks. There is no equivalent of a K8s webhook for a GitHub merge or a Terraform apply.
3. **The Revocation Gap**: TTL-based tokens (proposed in Issue #64) cannot be revoked. An admin denial after token issuance has no effect until expiry.

**Resolution for Problem 1**: The ordering problem is a false problem for the common case. The agent's target is not the PR — it is the **file the PR will modify**. The file already exists at approval time. A single-mode `AgentRequest` with a `github://` URI governs the file, not the delivery artifact. `StateFingerprint` is the file's blob SHA.

**Resolution for Problems 2 and 3**: AIP registers a webhook with the external platform (GitHub, Terraform Cloud) and receives events when mutations occur. At event time, AIP verifies that the actual changed resources match what was declared in the `AgentRequest` and that the base state has not drifted since T1. Because verification is live, revocation is instant — a denied or expired `AgentRequest` blocks the platform action immediately.

**External agent registration**: agents running outside the cluster (AWS Lambda, SaaS bots, scripts integrating with Salesforce or Snowflake) authenticate via API key or OIDC federation and are registered as `AgentIdentity` objects. Authorization to act on external resources is granted by listing the `AgentIdentity` name in `GovernedResource.spec.permittedAgents`. See `ep/agent_identity.md` for the full design.

---

## 2. Design Goals

1. **Govern the resource, not the delivery mechanism**: An `AgentRequest` targets the file or resource that will be mutated, not the PR or plan artifact.
2. **AIP is the active verifier**: AIP receives platform events via webhooks and sets enforcement status directly. The agent is not in the verification trust chain.
3. **Verify what actually changed**: At webhook time, AIP fetches the PR's changed files and verifies they match the declared `AgentRequest` target. Intent drift (agent approved for file A, opened PR for file B) is caught immediately.
4. **Plugin SDK for community ecosystem**: Each external system is a plugin implementing a stable interface. Adding a new platform requires no changes to core aip-k8s code.
5. **Single `GovernedResource` match per request**: One request → one `GovernedResource`. Multi-GR overlap is a Phase 2 problem.
6. **Graded enforcement model**: Not all platforms support native gates. The enforcement model is graded by platform capability — hard enforcement is preferred but not universally achievable:

   | Tier | Mechanism | How | Example |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Hard | Webhook + status | Platform pushes events to AIP; AIP sets required status | GitHub, Terraform Cloud |
   | Cooperative | `/verify` SDK call | Agent calls AIP before acting; spec.md §4.4 | Jira SDK, any custom agent |
   | Audit | Proxy intercept | AIP proxy intercepts and records; blocks if NetworkPolicy enforced | Slack, PagerDuty |

   `spec.md §4.4 /verify` remains the cooperative path for platforms and agents that cannot participate in the webhook model. Webhooks are the hard enforcement path. Both are first-class.

---

## 3. Core Design: Single-Mode for Known Resources

### 3.1 The Enforcement Flow

An agent that wants to update `nodepools/team-a/config.yaml`:

```
T1 — Intent Declaration
  Agent  →  AIP Gateway:  AgentRequest {
                            target.uri: github://myorg/infra/files/main/nodepools/team-a/config.yaml
                            action:     open-pr
                          }
  AIP Controller:  matches GovernedResource pattern
                   fetches blob SHA from GitHub → stores in status.evaluatedStateFingerprint
                   evaluates SafetyPolicies
                   phase → Approved
                   mints scoped GitHub installation token (repo:myorg/infra, contents:write, expires: timeBoundSeconds)
  AIP Gateway  →  Agent:  Grant { token: <installation token> }

T2 — Execution
  Agent  →  GitHub:  OpenPR(branch, commit: nodepools/team-a/config.yaml)
  Agent  →  AIP:     PATCH /agent-requests/req-xyz  (transition to Executing)
                     evidence: { prNumber: 42, repository: "myorg/infra" }
                     AIP stores this in status.executionEvidence

T3 — Webhook Verification (triggered by GitHub, not the agent)
  GitHub  →  AIP:  POST /hooks/github  (pull_request event: opened/synchronized)
                   Header: X-GitHub-Delivery: <unique-event-id>
  AIP:         dedup on X-GitHub-Delivery — replay protection
               look up AgentRequest via status.executionEvidence.prNumber + repository
               (NOT PR title parsing — title is user-editable text)
               fetch PR changed files via PR Files API (one paginated call)
               check: changed files ⊆ AgentRequest target URI     ← catches intent drift
               check: base blob SHA == status.evaluatedStateFingerprint  ← catches state drift
               check: AgentRequest phase == Executing              ← catches revocation
  AIP  →  GitHub:  set commit status "AIP Governance" = success | failure + reason

T4 — Merge Gate
  Engineer clicks merge → GitHub checks required status "AIP Governance"
                        → blocked if AIP status is failure
```

The agent's scoped token expires after `timeBoundSeconds`. After that, the agent has zero GitHub write access. The PR may still exist but the AIP status will reflect the expired/revoked state if someone tries to re-run the check.

### 3.2 What AIP Verifies at Webhook Time

The webhook handler runs the same checks regardless of platform:

1. **Phase check**: Is the `AgentRequest` in `Approved` or `Executing` phase?
2. **Intent drift check**: Are all changed resources covered by `spec.target.uri`? If the agent opened a PR touching `team-b/config.yaml` when approved for `team-a/config.yaml`, this fails.
3. **State drift check**: Does the base file's current blob SHA match `status.controlPlaneVerification.evaluatedStateFingerprint`? Catches out-of-band changes between T1 and T3.
4. **Generation check**: Does the `AgentRequest` generation match what was approved? Detects spec drift.

These checks run on every push to the PR branch (not just on open), so a new commit adding unauthorized files triggers a re-check.

**GitHub-specific**: changed files and their SHAs are retrieved via the PR Files API in a single paginated call:
```
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/files
```
Each entry returns `filename` and `sha` (the blob SHA of the file in the PR's head commit). This is one API call regardless of how many files changed — no per-file Contents API calls. The `sha` from this response is compared against `status.controlPlaneVerification.evaluatedStateFingerprint` for the state drift check.

### 3.3 Scoped Credential Delivery

When an `AgentRequest` transitions to `Approved`, the agent retrieves a scoped, short-lived credential via a dedicated subresource endpoint on the gateway — **never written to etcd**:

```
POST /agent-requests/{name}/token
```

This mirrors the K8s `TokenRequest` pattern (`POST /api/v1/namespaces/ns/serviceaccounts/sa/token`). The gateway calls the `CredentialMinter` plugin for the target URI scheme and returns the credential in the response body. Callers must be authenticated as the agent identity that created the request.

```
# Agent waits for Approved phase, then:
POST /agent-requests/req-xyz/token
Authorization: Bearer <agent-token>

Response:
{
  "token": "<scoped-github-installation-token>",
  "expiresAt": "2026-04-17T14:00:00Z",
  "scheme": "github"
}
```

Platform-specific credential scoping:
- **GitHub**: App installation token scoped to `org/repo`, `contents:write + pull_requests:write`, maximum TTL 1 hour (GitHub App limit).
- **Terraform Cloud**: workspace-scoped API token, expires at `timeBoundSeconds`.
- **K8s**: `TokenRequest` subresource on the agent's `ServiceAccount`, bound to `AgentRequest` name, expires at `timeBoundSeconds`.

The `/token` endpoint is idempotent within the credential's TTL: the first call mints and caches the credential; subsequent calls return the same token if it has not expired. If the cached token is expired or within 60 seconds of expiry, a fresh one is minted. If the `AgentRequest` is revoked, all subsequent calls return `409 Conflict` regardless of any cached token. Previously delivered credentials remain valid until their own platform TTL — the blast radius is bounded by the platform maximum (1 hour for GitHub App installation tokens).

The agent's baseline identity has no write access to any external system. All write access is mediated through AIP-issued scoped credentials.

```go
result, err := client.GovernedAction(ctx, aip.GovernedActionOpts{
    Action:           "open-pr",
    Target:           "github://myorg/infra/files/main/nodepools/team-a/config.yaml",
    Reason:           "team-a batch job requires 2x node capacity",
    TimeBoundSeconds: 3600,
}, func(grant *aip.Grant) error {
    // SDK calls POST /agent-requests/{name}/token internally.
    // grant.GitHubToken: scoped installation token, expires ≤ 1 hour.
    // After this function returns, the agent has no GitHub write access.
    gh := github.NewClient(oauth2.NewClient(ctx,
        oauth2.StaticTokenSource(&oauth2.Token{AccessToken: grant.GitHubToken})))
    return openPR(ctx, gh, grant.Name, newNodePoolConfig)
})
```

---

## 4. Plugin Architecture

Each external system is a plugin. Plugins are registered in a central registry keyed by URI scheme. The controller and gateway dispatch through the registry — no platform-specific logic in core code.

### 4.1 Plugin SDK Package

Community plugin authors import one package only:

```
github.com/agent-control-plane/aip-k8s/plugin
```

This package contains the interface definitions and shared types. It has no dependency on controller-runtime, K8s client, or gateway internals.

### 4.2 Plugin Interfaces

```go
// Plugin is the minimum required interface. Every plugin must implement this.
type Plugin interface {
    Scheme() string   // "github", "terraform", "jira"
    FetchContext(ctx context.Context, uri string) (*Context, error)
}

// CredentialMinter is implemented by plugins that issue scoped credentials at approval time.
// Optional. If not implemented, the agent must supply its own credentials (audit-grade only).
type CredentialMinter interface {
    MintCredential(ctx context.Context, req *CredentialRequest) (*Credential, error)
}

// WebhookPlugin is implemented by plugins for platforms that push events to AIP.
// AIP registers a webhook with the platform; the platform calls back when mutations occur.
// AIP verifies the event and sets a platform status check (pass/fail).
// Optional. Provides hard enforcement. Preferred over ProxyPlugin when the platform supports it.
type WebhookPlugin interface {
    ValidateWebhook(r *http.Request) error
    ExtractEvent(r *http.Request) (*EnforcementEvent, error)
    WriteResult(w http.ResponseWriter, result *VerifyResult)
}

// ProxyPlugin is implemented by plugins for platforms with no native event push.
// The AIP egress proxy intercepts outgoing HTTP calls and verifies before forwarding.
// Optional. Fallback enforcement for systems that cannot push events (Slack, some Jira configs).
type ProxyPlugin interface {
    IsMutation(req *http.Request) bool
    ExtractURI(req *http.Request) (string, error)
    ExtractAction(req *http.Request) (string, error)
}
```

A platform implements the interfaces it supports. Capability is discovered at runtime via type assertion:

```go
// Gateway webhook endpoint — platform-agnostic dispatch
if wp, ok := registry.WebhookPlugin(scheme); ok {
    // platform pushes events: GitHub, Terraform Cloud, Jira (with webhook registration)
    handleWebhook(w, r, wp)
} else if pp, ok := registry.ProxyPlugin(scheme); ok {
    // proxy intercepts outgoing calls: Slack, PagerDuty
    handleProxyRequest(w, r, pp)
}
```

### 4.3 Shared Types

```go
// Context is returned by FetchContext.
type Context struct {
    StateFingerprint string                 // blob SHA, state serial, ETag — opaque string
    ResourceExists   bool
    Raw              map[string]interface{} // stored in AgentRequestStatus.ProviderContext
}

// EnforcementEvent is the normalized event from a platform webhook.
type EnforcementEvent struct {
    // AgentRequestName is resolved by looking up status.executionEvidence in the
    // K8s API — NOT parsed from PR title or run message (user-editable text).
    AgentRequestName string
    ChangedResources []string          // URIs of resources being mutated
    BaseFingerprints map[string]string // current fingerprint per changed resource
    Action           string
    DeliveryID       string            // platform event ID for replay dedup (X-GitHub-Delivery etc.)
}

type CredentialRequest struct {
    URI              string
    Action           string
    TTL              time.Duration
    AgentRequestName string
}

type Credential struct {
    Token     string
    ExpiresAt time.Time
}
```

### 4.4 Registration

Plugins self-register via `init()`, identical to the `database/sql` driver pattern:

```go
// In the plugin package:
func init() {
    aipplugin.Register(New(configFromEnv()))
}

// In cmd/controller/main.go — blank imports activate plugins:
import (
    _ "github.com/agent-control-plane/aip-k8s-plugin-github"
    _ "github.com/agent-control-plane/aip-k8s-plugin-terraform"
    _ "github.com/acme-corp/aip-k8s-plugin-servicenow"  // community plugin
)
```

### 4.5 Webhook Endpoint

`POST /hooks/{scheme}` is a single generic endpoint. Each plugin handles its own signature validation and payload parsing:

```go
// Gateway: POST /hooks/{scheme}
func (h *webhookHandler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    scheme := chi.URLParam(r, "scheme")
    wp, ok := registry.WebhookPlugin(scheme)
    if !ok {
        http.NotFound(w, r)
        return
    }
    if err := wp.ValidateWebhook(r); err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "invalid signature", http.StatusUnauthorized)
        return
    }
    event, err := wp.ExtractEvent(r)
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }
    result := h.verifyEvent(r.Context(), event)  // platform-agnostic verification
    wp.WriteResult(w, result)
}
```

The `verifyEvent` logic is platform-agnostic and shared across all webhook plugins:

```go
func (g *Gateway) verifyEvent(ctx context.Context, event *plugin.EnforcementEvent) *VerifyResult {
    ar, err := g.getAgentRequest(ctx, event.AgentRequestName)
    if err != nil {
        return denied("request not found")
    }
    if ar.Status.Phase != PhaseApproved && ar.Status.Phase != PhaseExecuting {
        return denied("request not in Approved phase — may have been revoked")
    }
    for _, changedURI := range event.ChangedResources {
        if !uriMatchesTarget(changedURI, ar.Spec.Target.URI) {
            return denied(fmt.Sprintf("resource %s not covered by this request (intent drift)", changedURI))
        }
        if fp, ok := event.BaseFingerprints[changedURI]; ok {
            if fp != ar.Status.ControlPlaneVerification.EvaluatedStateFingerprint {
                return denied("resource state changed since approval (state drift)")
            }
        }
    }
    return verified()
}
```

## 5. Platform Tiers

| Platform | ContextFetcher | CredentialMinter | WebhookPlugin | ProxyPlugin | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| K8s | resourceVersion | `TokenRequest` | — (admission webhook) | — | Hard |
| GitHub | blob SHA | App installation token | `pull_request` events | optional | Hard |
| Terraform Cloud | state serial | workspace token | run task callback | — | Hard |
| Jira | issue state | OAuth 2.0 token | issue transition webhook | fallback | Hard / Audit |
| ArgoCD | sync status | project token | sync webhook | — | Hard |
| Slack | — | bot token | — | channel proxy | Audit |
| PagerDuty | incident state | scoped token | — | API proxy | Audit |

Hard enforcement requires either a `WebhookPlugin` (platform pushes events to AIP) or a `ProxyPlugin` with NetworkPolicy restricting direct egress. Audit-grade applies when neither is feasible.

---

## 6. Three Concrete Examples

### 6.1 Karpenter GitOps (GitHub)

**Setup** (done once by platform engineer):
- Register webhook `https://aip.internal/hooks/github` on `myorg/infra` repo
- Mark `AIP Governance` as a required status check on `main`

**Per-operation flow**:
- Agent submits `AgentRequest` for `github://myorg/infra/files/main/nodepools/team-a/config.yaml`, `action: open-pr`
- Controller fetches blob SHA → stores in `status.evaluatedStateFingerprint` → `Approved`
- Agent receives `Grant.GitHubToken` (scoped to `myorg/infra`, `contents:write`, 1h)
- Agent creates branch, commits `nodepools/team-a/config.yaml`, opens PR
- Agent calls `PATCH /agent-requests/req-xyz` to transition to `Executing` with evidence `{prNumber: 42, repository: "myorg/infra"}`
- GitHub fires `pull_request` webhook to AIP (`X-GitHub-Delivery: abc-123`)
- AIP deduplicates on delivery ID, looks up AgentRequest via stored `prNumber=42 + repository=myorg/infra` (not PR title), fetches PR files via PR Files API, checks `nodepools/team-a/config.yaml` matches target URI, checks blob SHA
- AIP sets `AIP Governance = success` on the PR head commit
- Engineer reviews, clicks merge — GitHub enforces required status check
- Any subsequent push to the PR branch re-triggers the webhook and re-checks

**If the agent opens a PR for `team-b/config.yaml` instead**: AIP sets `AIP Governance = failure`, reason `intent drift`. Merge is blocked.

### 6.2 Terraform Cloud

**Setup** (done once by platform engineer):
- Register AIP as a Run Task on the Terraform Cloud organization: `https://aip.internal/hooks/terraform`
- Set enforcement level: `mandatory` on target workspaces

**Per-operation flow**:
- Agent submits `AgentRequest` for `terraform://myorg/workspaces/prod-nodegroup-team-a`, `action: apply`
- Controller fetches state serial → `Approved`
- Agent receives `Grant.TerraformToken` (scoped to `prod-nodegroup-team-a`, 30m)
- Agent queues a run: `[aip:req-xyz] governed apply`
- Terraform Cloud calls AIP Run Task callback before apply: `POST /hooks/terraform`
- AIP checks workspace URI, state serial, phase
- AIP returns `{"status": "passed"}` or `{"status": "failed", "message": "..."}`
- Terraform Cloud proceeds or cancels the run accordingly

### 6.3 Jira

**Setup** (done once by platform engineer):
- Register Jira webhook for project INFRA: `https://aip.internal/hooks/jira`, events: `issue_updated`
- Or: deploy AIP egress proxy + NetworkPolicy if webhook registration is not permitted

**Per-operation flow (webhook model)**:
- Agent submits `AgentRequest` for `jira://myorg/projects/INFRA/issues/INFRA-123`, `action: transition`
- Controller fetches issue state → `Approved`
- Agent receives `Grant.JiraToken` (OAuth 2.0, project INFRA, 15m)
- Agent transitions the issue
- Jira fires `issue_updated` webhook to AIP
- AIP checks issue key matches AgentRequest target URI, issue state matches fingerprint
- AIP records `AuditRecord` — pass or fail

**Note**: Jira has no mechanism to block a transition after the fact (webhook fires post-transition). The enforcement model here is **detect and record**, not block. For blocking enforcement, deploy the proxy model with NetworkPolicy.

---

## 7. What This Does Not Solve (Deferred)

1. **Scoped-mode requests** (`executionMode: scoped`): agents that do not know the specific resource upfront. Requires pattern containment checks and OpsLock acquisition per matching resource.

2. **Multi-`GovernedResource` overlap**: a single request spanning URIs governed by multiple `GovernedResource` objects. Requires union-of-policies evaluation.

3. **Dynamic webhook registration**: When a platform engineer creates a `GovernedResource` for a GitHub repo, AIP should automatically register the webhook on that repo. Currently requires manual one-time setup. Controller can manage this via the GitHub App API — deferred to Phase 3.

4. **Fine-grained action filtering**: Phase 3 verifies that changed resources match the target URI. It does not verify the nature of the change (e.g., only `maxNodes` field changed, not the node type). Schema-level diff validation is a later concern.

5. **Plugin SDK interfaces**: Do not design plugin interfaces before two platform implementations exist. The interface designed before two real implementations is almost always wrong. Extract after Phase 3 (GitHub) and Phase 3+ (Terraform) are both working.

---

## 8. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — Cooperative GitHub PR Governance ✓ DONE
**Goal**: first real agent submits `AgentRequest` before opening a GitHub PR. Humans review via dashboard. OpsLock prevents duplicates. No webhooks, no plugins, no credential minting.

- Replace `path.Match` with a `**`-aware glob matcher (`gobwas/glob`) — `path.Match` does not cross `/` boundaries, so `github://myorg/infra/files/main/nodepools/**` silently matches nothing
- Fix OpsLock renewal: `reconcileExecuting` detects lease expiry but never renews — patch `RenewTime` on each requeue, requeue at half lease duration; without this, any PR review longer than 5 minutes fails the request
- Remove K8s-only URI scheme restrictions from gateway admission — accept any URI scheme
- Document and enforce `github://{org}/{repo}/files/{branch}/{path}` URI convention in `spec.md §3.6`
- Confirm CEL evaluates safely with empty `target.*` for `github://` URIs with no context fetcher (already safe — `cel.go` falls back to empty `TargetContext`)

**Does NOT require**: GitHub App, webhooks, blob SHA fetching, plugin interfaces, credential minting.

---

### Phase 2 — Verdict Grading + DiagnosticAccuracySummary
**Goal**: humans grade `AgentRequest` reasoning as correct/partial/incorrect. Aggregate into per-agent accuracy scores. Foundation for agents earning autonomy.

**Key design decision**: `AgentDiagnostic` is an internal CRD — never exposed to agent developers. The agent SDK has one method: `agentRequest(target, action, reason)`. No mode flag. The control plane decides the outcome based on trust level:

- `Observer` level → request is evaluated and graded, action is NOT taken. Agent is told the verdict.
- `Advisor/Supervised` level → request queued for human approval, executed if approved.
- `Trusted/Autonomous` level → auto-approved if `SafetyPolicy` passes, executed.

The agent does not need to know its own trust level or declare intent. The cluster admin configures the graduation policy once. The control plane enforces it on every request.

**Why this comes before trust profiles**: grading accuracy is the primary signal. We need scored data before we can compute a meaningful trust level. The accuracy score accumulated here feeds directly into `AgentTrustProfile` in Phase 3.

- `PATCH /agent-requests/{name}/verdict` — human grader sets `correct / partial / incorrect`; only valid on requests in `AwaitingVerdict` phase (Observer-level requests)
- `POST /agent-requests/recompute-accuracy` — reconstruct `DiagnosticAccuracySummary` from all graded requests for an agent
- `DiagnosticAccuracySummary` CR: running accuracy ratio per `agentIdentity` — `(correct + 0.5*partial) / total`
- No enforcement yet — accuracy is visible but not gating until Phase 3

---

### Phase 3 — AgentTrustProfile + AgentGraduationPolicy (Prescriptive Enforcement)
**Goal**: cluster admin defines graduation thresholds once. Control plane enforces them on every request. No CEL expression required to get baseline trust enforcement.

**Why prescriptive, not descriptive**: a `SafetyPolicy` that checks `agent.trustLevel` only works if someone writes the policy. Prescriptive enforcement means the gateway rejects requests that don't meet the trust floor regardless of whether a `SafetyPolicy` exists. `SafetyPolicy` CEL adds restrictions on top — it cannot bypass the trust gate.

**Two new CRDs**:

`AgentGraduationPolicy` (cluster-scoped, one per cluster, owned by cluster admin):
```yaml
spec:
  levels:
    - name: Observer      # action NOT taken, request graded
      minObserveVerdicts: 0
      minDiagnosticAccuracy: 0.0
      canExecute: false
    - name: Advisor       # action taken, human approval required every time
      minObserveVerdicts: 10
      minDiagnosticAccuracy: 0.70
      minExecutions: 0
      requiresHumanApproval: true
    - name: Supervised
      minObserveVerdicts: 20
      minDiagnosticAccuracy: 0.85
      minExecutions: 20
      requiresHumanApproval: true
    - name: Trusted       # auto-approved if SafetyPolicy passes
      minObserveVerdicts: 50
      minDiagnosticAccuracy: 0.92
      minExecutions: 50
      requiresHumanApproval: false
    - name: Autonomous
      minObserveVerdicts: 100
      minDiagnosticAccuracy: 0.97
      minExecutions: 100
      requiresHumanApproval: false
```

`GovernedResource.spec.trustRequirements` (per-resource trust floor and ceiling, only cluster admin can modify):
```yaml
trustRequirements:
  minTrustLevel: Trusted      # hard floor — lower levels blocked entirely
  maxAutonomyLevel: Supervised # hard ceiling — even Trusted/Autonomous require human approval
```

`AgentTrustProfile` (controller-owned, nobody writes it directly):
```yaml
status:
  trustLevel: Advisor
  diagnosticAccuracy: 0.81
  totalObserveVerdicts: 14
  successRate: 0.0
  totalExecutions: 0
  nextLevelRequirements:
    level: Supervised
    remaining:
      minObserveVerdicts: 6
      minDiagnosticAccuracy: 0.04
      minExecutions: 20
```

**Gateway enforcement on every execute request**:
1. Find matching `GovernedResource` for `spec.target.uri`
2. Fetch agent's `AgentTrustProfile.trustLevel`
3. Check `GovernedResource.trustRequirements.minTrustLevel` — reject with 403 if below floor
4. Apply `GovernedResource.trustRequirements.maxAutonomyLevel` as ceiling on behavior
5. Check `AgentGraduationPolicy` for whether this level requires human approval
6. Run `SafetyPolicy` CEL evaluation (additional restrictions, cannot override steps 1–5)

**`nextLevelRequirements` in status** makes the graduation ladder legible — operators see exactly what the agent needs to advance without reading policy YAML.

---

### Phase 4 — GitHub Webhook Verification
**Goal**: defense-in-depth. AIP verifies the actual PR matches what was approved. Catches intent drift and state drift.

**Why this comes after trust profiles**: webhook verification is a per-integration hardening step. It cannot substitute for a cross-agent trust signal. An agent that earns trust through accurate diagnosis and correct execution across many requests is safer than an agent that simply passes webhook verification once.

- GitHub context fetcher: fetch file blob SHA via `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}` → `status.evaluatedStateFingerprint`
- `POST /hooks/github` endpoint: validate `X-GitHub-Signature-256` HMAC; deduplicate on `X-GitHub-Delivery`
- Verification logic: intent drift (changed files ⊆ `target.uri`), state drift (blob SHA match), phase check
- GitHub commit status: set `AIP Governance = success/failure`; configure as required status check on target repo
- PR correlation: agent writes `{prNumber, repository}` to `status.executionEvidence` when signalling `Executing`; webhook resolves `AgentRequest` via stored evidence, not PR title parsing
- Replay protection: store seen `X-GitHub-Delivery` IDs in a short-lived cache (TTL = webhook retry window)

**Build directly — hardcode the GitHub handler. Do not design plugin interfaces yet.**

---

### Phase 5 — Plugin SDK Extraction
**Goal**: extract common interfaces when the Terraform integration forces the abstraction.

**Why not earlier**: interfaces designed before two real implementations exist are almost always wrong. Extract after Phase 4 (GitHub) and a second platform (Terraform) are both working. The interface will be obvious at that point; it is not obvious now.

- Extract `ContextFetcher` interface from GitHub + K8s fetcher implementations
- Extract `WebhookVerifier` interface from the hardcoded GitHub webhook handler
- `PluginRegistry` with scheme-based dispatch; explicit registration in `main.go`, not `init()` blank imports
- Terraform Cloud plugin as the second implementation that validates the interfaces

### Phase 6 — Credential Gating
**Goal**: agents with zero baseline write access. Opt-in per `GovernedResource`.

- `POST /agent-requests/{name}/token` subresource: idempotent within TTL (return cached credential if not expired, mint fresh within 60s of expiry); `409` on revoked request
- `CredentialMinter` interface: `MintCredential` + `RevokeCredential`; revoke on `AgentRequest` denial or expiry
- GitHub App installation token minting: scoped to repo, `contents:write`, max 1h TTL
- `spec.credentialGating: true` on `GovernedResource` — independent of webhook verification; orthogonal capability

### Phase 7 — GitHub Outcome Signal → AgentTrustProfile (LAST)
**Goal**: automatically update `AgentTrustProfile` from GitHub PR outcomes: merged = correct, merged with significant reviewer changes = partial, closed without merge = incorrect.

**Why this is last**: the diagnosis grading path (Phase 2) covers ~95% of the trust signal problem. An agent that accurately diagnoses issues and is calibrated against human judgment is already well-characterized. Wrong PR content — the agent writes the wrong change — is a deterministic agent code issue: it is repeatable, debuggable, and fixable by improving the agent independently of the AIP governance layer. Investing heavily in automatic outcome extraction before the diagnosis grading foundation is solid would optimize the wrong signal first. Build this only after `AgentTrustProfile` is consuming Phase 2 accuracy data and the graduation ladder is operational.

**Why not a substitute for diagnosis grading**: GitHub merge outcome is a lagging, coarse-grained signal — it takes days to weeks to accumulate, it conflates agent error with reviewer taste, and it provides no per-category breakdown. Diagnosis grading is immediate, fine-grained, and human-interpretable. The GitHub signal is additive, not foundational.

- Webhook handler (from Phase 4) extended: on `pull_request.closed` with `merged=true`, classify outcome from PR diff size vs agent's original diff
- PR label convention (optional): `aip:correct`, `aip:partial`, `aip:incorrect` labels allow reviewers to override automated classification
- `AgentTrustProfile` controller: consume GitHub outcome events alongside Phase 2 verdict data
- Decay function: recent outcomes weighted more heavily than historical ones (configurable half-life)

### Phase 8 — Scoped Mode and Multi-GR
- `executionMode: scoped` pattern containment check at admission
- OpsLock acquisition per matching resource pattern
- Union-of-policies evaluation for multi-GR overlap
- Controller manages webhook lifecycle: auto-register/deregister webhooks when `GovernedResource` is created/deleted
